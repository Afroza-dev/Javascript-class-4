            <h1>Top 35 eCommerce sites in Bangladesh (2024)</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>Bangladesh’s eCommerce industry has made great strides, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people now prefer to shop online, leading to significant growth.

                Experts predict an annual growth rate of 17.61% and a market size of 149,280 crore by 2026. The eCommerce Association of Bangladesh (e-Cab) reports around 700 active eCommerce websites in the country.
                
                However, not all of them are equally trustworthy. In this article, we’ll delve into the 35 most reliable eCommerce sites in Bangladesh, helping you find the right one for your needs.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h1>Short History of eCommerce sites in Bangladesh</h1>
                <br><br>
                
                <p>
                    On January 10, 2000, the first eCommerce site in Bangladesh (BD) was launched. The website, “Munshigi.com,” was developed to sell gift items and even offered cash on delivery to customers.
                    
                    At that time, online shopping was entirely new in Bangladesh, so the initial reception was not very positive. The first order on that website was placed after about 40 days of its launch.
                    
                    Since then, many eCommerce sites in Bangladesh have slowly emerged and left the market, including Munshigiri.
                    
                    The significant shift in the market came when the eCommerce sites Akhoni.com (now Bagdoom.com) and Ajkerdeal.com launched in 2011.
                    
                    After the successful launching of these eCommerce sites in Bangladesh, many new websites emerged, creating an uprising in growth in the industry. It took many years before online shopping became a popular option for many people.
                    
                    Nowadays, various types of electronic commerce companies operate in the Bangladesh market, ranging from business-to-consumer (B2C) sites to consumer-to-consumer (C2C) and business-to-business (B2B) websites.</p>
